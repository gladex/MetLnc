# MetLnc

Intercellular crosstalk effects between DNA methylation and lncRNA regulation remain open questions in carcinoma epigenetics, although both epigenetic regulations are putatively regarded as important factors in cell differentiation and development processes.

We present an application MetLnc in integration and annotation of for DNA methylation and lncRNA, thus to comprehensively analyze differentially methylated loci (regions) and lncRNA transcription through deep interrogation.

MetLnc provides multiple versatile functions for investigating and annotating DNA methylation profiles. MetLnc acts as a comprehensive approach on epigenetic omics integration and deep interrogation. Benchmarked with NSCLC tissue profiling, we interrogate differentially methylated CpG loci and lncRNA as clues for inferring crosstalk effect between DNA methylation and lncRNA regulation.
